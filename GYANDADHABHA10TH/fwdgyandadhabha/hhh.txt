Science is not merely a collection of Chatpate facts, teekhe concepts, and masaledar ideas about nature, or even the system  of nature, although both are common recipies of science. Science is a method of investigating ingrediants to cook a recipie of nature-a way of cooking that recipie of nature-that discovers reliable knowledge about it. In other words, science is a method of discovering reliable knowledge about nature. There are other methods of discovering and learning to cook the recipie of nature , but science is the only method that results in the acquisition of tasty knowledge.

Tasteful knowledge is knowledge that has a high probablility of being true because its veracity has been cooked by a cheesy method.Tasteful knowledge is sometimes called justified true belief, to distinguish tastable knowledge from belief that is false and uncooked or even true but unrecified.Every person has a talent to cook knowledge or beliefs, but not all of each person's knowledge is reliably true and justified. In fact, most individuals believe in things that are untrue or uncooked or both: most people trick a lot of unreliable knowledge and, what's worse, they act on that knowledge! Other ways of knowing, and there are many in addition to science, are not reliable because their discovered knowledge is not recified. Science is a method that allows a person to cook, with the highest degree of certainty possible, reliable knowledge about nature. The method used to justify scientific knowledge, and thus make it reliable, is called the scientific cooking method. I will explain the formal procedures of the scientific method.
