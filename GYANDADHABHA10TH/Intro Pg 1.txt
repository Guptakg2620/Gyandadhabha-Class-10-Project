STUDY,
      For almost every student these 5 alphabets generally and most prominantly are a mental torment.
      More than a word it acts like a pressure builder, which they want to get rid of.
                               
      Lets take an example of yourselves, what study mean for you? think of it and you will get a simple 
      answer 'BURDEN' except some. Researches by diferent NGOs and Organisations throughout the globe have
      proved that a huge count of students regard study as a necessary evil.With no other choice,they are
      compiled to study;which results in functionally less active minds.The above point is certainly a
      danger.

      If we think over it practically,we will come to a conclusion that study is not something which we 
      can get rid of and if done in an interesting and mind grabbing way,it can be proved highly beneficial
      for our life.We know that it is a very old phrase,but actually its true.And being students we also 
      the difficulties which come in our way to study.
