The main problem is that we could not interpret or implement it in our daily life.

Remember,study should be interesting and mind grabbing.So, how to make it somewhat interesting? First,we put our minds and desired of linking to our study in such type of thing which we all likes.How,could we forget that we live in India and in India nothing is left without our Indian tadka.

So,we decided to combine our boring study to our delicious and mouth watering food.
